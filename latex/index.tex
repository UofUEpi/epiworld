 Although {\ttfamily epiworld} is a header-\/only C++ library, we do make use of other cool projects in some of the examples and for testing. The \href{https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily cxxopts}}} library provides a smooth interface for using options in your C++ program. \href{https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily catch2}}} is a great C++ unit-\/tests framework that we have use in \href{https://github.com/USCbiostats/barry}{\texttt{ other projects}}.

Although you are free to use {\ttfamily epiworld/}, we also have a single-\/header version that incorporates all its components \href{../epiworld.hpp}{\texttt{ here}}.
